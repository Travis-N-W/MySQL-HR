# HR Data Analysis Project – MySQL & Power BI

## Brief Objective 

Conducted end-to-end data analysis on a sample HR dataset using MySQL and Power BI. The project involved comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, including standardizing date formats, converting text fields to appropriate data types, and resolving data inconsistencies. Developed SQL queries based on a set of business-related questions to extract actionable insights. Designed and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key HR metrics such as employee distribution, tenure, attrition rates, and departmental performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Data Limitations

- Records with negative age values (967 entries) were excluded from the analysis; only data for individuals aged 18 and above were considered.  
- Termination dates that were unrealistically far in the future (1599 entries) were omitted; only termination dates up to the current date were included in the analysis.
